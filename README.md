eleven-QA

This tool has been designed to search an archive of player street snaps to work out the co-ordinates and variant of items on streets and to make those changes in JSON files. It forms part of the QA team effort working on the Eleven project (http://elevengiants.com/) to restore the game of Glitch.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.
Downoad the code into a convenient directory.
Create a config.json using the sample included in this repository.
Create a working directory where the debug_output.txt and temporary JSON folders will be created.
Create a folder which contains the street snaps for the streets being examined.
